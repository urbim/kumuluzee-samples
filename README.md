# KumuluzEE Samples

> These samples demonstrate how to get started using KumuluzEE microservice framework. They provide small, specific, working samples that can be used as a reference for your own projects.

These samples and quickstarts contain several working projects that demonstrate how to use [KumuluzEE](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee) microservices. They also serve as test projects for the framework itself.

We recommend that you go through some of these samples to get a better understanding of the framework and use them
as a reference for your own projects.

Keep in mind that while projects containing multiple microservices are located in the same repository in order to simplify things, is is often recommended that you separate microservices by repository as well.

Samples will be constantly added over time.

## About

The samples demonstrate many different use cases for using KumuluzEE to create self-sustaining microservices. The latest
version of the samples will always use the latest version of the KumuluzEE framework. Therefore, it is recommended to use the latest version of the KumuluzEE framework for these samples. This way, you will also get all the latest features of the KumuluzEE. Refer to the usage section on how to build and run the samples.

Some samples are tagged as well. The tags (eg. `v2.2.0`) will correspond to the KumuluzEE release version in order to easily access the
desired version of the framework that is used in the examples. Tha `master` branch will always use the latest snapshot version of the framework
and the latest samples.

If you wish to use a snapshot version of KumuluzEE when running the samples, you must make sure you add the Sonatype snapshots
repository to your `pom.xml`. The `master` branch already contains the repository as it's targeted against the snapshot
version of the framework.

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>sonatype-snapshots</id>
        <name>Sonatype Snapshots</name>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
        <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

## Requirements

In order to run these examples as they are intended, you will need the following:

1. Java 8 (or newer), you can use any implementation:
    * If you have installed Java, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
        
        ```
        java -version
        ```

2. Maven 3.2.1 (or newer):
    * If you have installed Maven, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
        
        ```
        mvn -version
        ```
        
3. Git:
    * If you have installed Git, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
    
        ```
        git --version
        ```
        
## Usage

1. Clone the Git repository containing the examples:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples.git
    ```
    
2. Checkout the desired tagged version of the examples and the KumuluzEE framework (alternatively skip this step if you want the latest and greatest)

    ```
    cd kumuluzee-examples
    git checkout v2.0.0
    ```
    
To run a specific sample, please refer to the specific README file of the sample.
Most of the time you either build and run it directly with a maven command or build Docker containers and run them.
